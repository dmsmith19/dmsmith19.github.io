        <h2>How To Play:</h2>
        <!--Insert paragraph about how to play-->
        <p>Lacrosse is one of the oldest sports. It plays like a combination of soccer and hockey. It has the physicality of hockey but played on a larger outdoor field. There are different variations of lacrosse but we will stick with field lacrosse, click <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/lacrosse/types.htm">here</a>. In the college level, the game is divided into 4 quarters that are 15 minutes long. The field is split in half with a middle line (50 yard line) with the endlines being 5 yards into the endzone. Field lacrosse is played with 10 people per team on the field at a time, 3 attack, 3 midfielders, 3 defenders, and 1 goalie. Even though everyone has a certain position, anyone can go everywhere on the field. The only rule is that you can’t have more than 6 people in the offensive side of the half. You are also allowed as many substitutions as you want; like hockey, the substitution is done on the fly. The unlimited substitutions are crucial because the ball is also moving from the offensive side to the defensive side. There are specialty players that include <abbr>LSM</abbr> (Long Stick Mid), <abbr>Fogo</abbr> (Faceoff Get Off), <abbr>D-mid</abbr> (Defensive Midfielder) and <abbr>O-Mid</abbr> (Offensive Midfielder). Having these specialty players and unlimited substitutions help with increase scoring opportunities since you can have possession of the ball for 80 seconds until the ball goes to the other team. If your defense stops the other team from scoring during their possession, you receive the ball and must “clear” it to the offensive side in 20 seconds. During the clearing, teams will be subbing players on and off the field, it gets chaotic, to get the right personnel for the switch of possession. The game will go back and forth until someone scores or the quarter ends. Once when this happens, a faceoff will occur to start the new possession. The ball do not automatically go back to the team that got scored on, you must earn the possession of the ball. It seems like a lot to learn but when you watch lacrosse, it is easy to follow along and it has action throughout the whole game.

        <h2>Origin:</h2>
        <!--Insert paragraph about how to play-->
        <p>Lacrosse original started as “Indian Stickball” in the 1630’s among Native American tribes around the Great Lakes. This game was used in many ways. It was mostly used as a war game to help prepare warriors for battle, so men were the only ones allowed to play. They would play on fields anywhere from 500 yards to a couple miles. This helped toughen up, condition and practice hand-eye coordination in the warriors. There was also no defined limit of players, depending on the field size, they were allowed up to 100,000 players at times. Even though lacrosse has war time roots, the main roots are spiritual. Many Native Americans called lacrosse the “Medicine Game”; they believed that playing lacrosse would heal you because you were one with natural while playing. Many times, they would designate an area around a river to play because they believe the river would preform “cleaning rituals”. The first sticks they used looked like wooden spoons with a leather pocket to carry the ball, which was first made from wood but quickly changed to a deer skin ball filled with fur. Then in the early 1800’s, European colonist adopted the sport and started playing recreational. In the 1860’s, a Canadian dentist names William George Beers created Lacrosse with official rules and started the spread of the game.</p>

                    <dl>
                        <dt>Helemt:</dt>
                    <dd>The helmet is used to protect your head from injuries. It does this by slowing the rotation of your head during impact. Helmets have a all-around protects going from below your chin to protecting the back of your head. It also has a cage in front to allow you to see but doesn’t allow a ball through. Many teams put decals on their helmets to customize their look. </dd>
                    <dt>Gloves:</dt>
                    <dd>The gloves are used to protect your hands from getting hit by opponent sticks. They are similar to hockey gloves but less bulky. They have padding on the back of the glove and go up past your wrist for added protection. Companies will use different material for the palm of the glove. Some use all fabric, and some use a combination of fabric and mesh. Everyone likes a different pair of gloves, so it’s best to try on many types to find the ones that work best with you.</dd>
                    <dt>Elbow Pads:</dt>
                    <dd>Elbow Pads are used to protect your elbows from incoming checks from opponents sticks. They fit snug around your elbows but still allow from back-and-forth movement. They come in a variety of sizes depending on preference and positioning. If you play attack, you will normally want a larger pad because you get checked more often. If you play defense, you would normally choice a smaller pad because you get more movement in your elbow to throw checks and you don’t get checked too often. </dd>
                    <dt>Chest Pads:</dt>
                    <dd>The chest protector is used to soften the impact if you get hit my a ball or stick check. It will have padding on the front and a small amount of padding on the back. Recently, chest protectors have been required to have a <abbr>EKG</abbr> (Electrocardiography) to help protect from Commotio Cordis which happens during low impact trauma like taking a shot to the chest.</dd>
                    <dt>Stick:</dt>
                    <dd>Your stick is used to catch, throw, and carry the ball throughout the game. Modern sticks are made up of the shaft (the metal part you hold), head (the plastic scoop on top of the shaft), and the mesh (this is strung into the head to create a pocket to hold the ball). Sticks are the most customizable equipment in lacrosse. There are many different combinations of shafts, sticks, mesh, and patterning of stringing the mesh. Sticks have changed a lot throughout the years. They original started as a wooded stick with a spoon shape on the end. It is a lot easier to catch and pass with modern sticks than older sticks.</dd>
                    <dt>Cleats:</dt>
                    <dd>You wear cleats during lacrosse to help gain grip while running. You can use either lacrosse cleats or soccer cleats at most levels. They must have plastic spikes to make sure you can’t puncture someone’s foot if stepped on. Each person has a specific cleat that they enjoy, just like regular shoes. </dd>
