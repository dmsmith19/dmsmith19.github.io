        <p>Lacrosse is one of the oldest sports. It plays like a combination of soccer and hockey. It has the physicality of hockey but played on a larger outdoor field. There are different variations of lacrosse but we will stick with field lacrosse, click <a href="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/lacrosse/types.htm">here</a>. In the college level, the game is divided into 4 quarters that are 15 minutes long. The field is split in half with a middle line(50 yard line) with the endlines being 5 yards into the endzone. Field lacrosse is played with 10 people per team on the field at a time, 3 attack, 3 midfielders, 3 defenders, and 1 goalie. Even though everyone has a certain position, anyone can go everywhere on the field. The only rule is that you can’t have more than 6 people in the offensive side of the half. You are also allowed as many substitutions as you want; like hockey, the substitution is done on the fly. The unlimited substitutions are crucial because the ball is also moving from the offensive side to the defensive side. There are specialty players that include <abbr>LSM</abbr> (Long Stick Mid), <abbr>Fogo</abbr> (Faceoff Get Off), <abbr>D-mid</abbr> (Defensive Midfielder) and <abbr>O-Mid</abbr> (Offensive Midfielder). Having these specialty players and unlimited substitutions help with increase scoring opportunities since you can have possession of the ball for 80 seconds until the ball goes to the other team. If your defense stops the other team from scoring during their possession, you receive the ball and have to “clear” it to the offensive side in 20 seconds. During the clearing, teams will be subbing players on and off the field, it gets chaotic, to get the right personnel for the switch of possession. The game will go back and forth until someone scores or the quarter ends. Once when this happens, a faceoff will occur to start the new possession. The ball do not automatically go back to the team that got scored on, you have to earn the possession of the ball. It seems like a lot to learn but when you watch lacrosse, it is easy to follow along and it has action throughout the whole game.
